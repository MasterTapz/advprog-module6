## Reflection 1

The handle_connection function begins by taking a TCP stream as input, which represents an active connection from a web browser sending an HTTP request. It then wraps this stream, which has been set as mutable, with a buffered reader. This buffering helps reduce the number of system calls required. 

Since the stream is now buffered, it allows reading the content line by line using the lines method. Each line is processed using the map function to extract its value, assuming that all lines are read successfully. The function continues reading until it encounters an empty line, which indicates the end of the HTTP header section. The collected lines are stored in a vector of strings and then displayed in a structured format using the println function.
